		<h2>What it is</h2>
		Filters the messages and elements, to make it easier to locate the desired messages
		or elements.

		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		Messages and elements are filtered using Java regular expressions.
		Type in the expression, and select "Go".  To remove the filter, 
		clear the Search box and click "Go".  As shown in the example above,
		the entire message name was entered, and the corresponding elements
		also remain.  The example below shows using the wildcard ".*", which means
		any number of any characters can follow "ACFT".  As shown, messages that
		do not match the pattern remain if they contain any elements that do match
		the pattern.
